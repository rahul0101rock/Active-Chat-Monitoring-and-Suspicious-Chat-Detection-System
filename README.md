# Active Chat Monitoring and Suspicious Chat Detection System
**Active chat monitoring and suspicious chat detection is a chat system where suspicious users are identified by determining the keywords used by him/her. The main purpose of this project is to develop software that can be used to find a system that identifies deception in messages through communication. The system can be designed in a way that the users can easily interact with the system with minimum knowledge to browse the internet. It detects what kinds of information are being passed from the users and can detect their whole conversation without their notice. It can be used along with most widely used social sites like face book, twitter, etc. to provide security against cyber-crime. By the use of this system, one can be saved from involving in illegal activities and from being a cyber victim**
